Stock Clustering for Investment & ESG Insights

This project clusters ~485 companies into Safe, Moderate, and Risky groups using Hierarchical, K-Means, and DBSCAN, based on financial (volatility, beta, market cap) and ESG (environment, social, governance) traits. Interactive Plotly visualizations (PCA, trait comparisons) reveal risk profiles, sector trends, and ESG-volatility links. Hierarchical clustering excels (silhouette ~0.225), guiding investment and business strategies.

Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly
