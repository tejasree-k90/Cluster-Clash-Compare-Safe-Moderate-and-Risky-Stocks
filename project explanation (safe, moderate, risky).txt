Overview: What Is the Project About?
Imagine you have a huge list of about 485 companies, like Apple, Amazon, or smaller firms like Albemarle (a chemical company). Each company has different traits, like how much their stock prices go up and down, how big they are, or how well they treat the environment. This project is about sorting these companies into three groups based on how similar they are, so we can understand them better. We call these groups Safe, Moderate, and Risky, like labeling toys as sturdy, okay, or fragile.

Safe companies are big, steady, and trusted, like Apple—they don’t surprise you with big losses.
Moderate companies are reliable and super well-managed, like banks (e.g., Aflac), but they stick to one type of business.
Risky companies are smaller and jumpy, like Albemarle—their stocks swing a lot, which can be exciting but scary.
We use a computer program (written in Python) to do this sorting, trying three different methods—K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN—to see which one organizes the companies best. Each method looks at 11 traits, like risk, size, and how ethical the companies are, to decide who belongs together. At the end, we save the results in files so we can check which group each company is in, like a sorted list of names.

Why Are We Doing This?
This project is useful because it helps us make sense of a messy pile of information about companies. Here’s why it matters:

Helping with Investments:
If someone wants to invest money, they might pick Safe companies (like Apple) for steady growth, Moderate ones (like banks) for reliability, or Risky ones (like Albemarle) for a chance at big wins (but with more danger).
Grouping companies makes it easier to choose, like picking friends for a team based on their strengths.
Understanding Businesses:
We can learn why some companies are stable (e.g., big size, steady stocks) or why others are risky (e.g., jumpy stocks, smaller size).
For example, we might find that banks are great at management, which helps explain how they operate.
Studying Ethics:
The project looks at how companies handle the environment, workers, and management (called ESG scores). This shows which groups care about being responsible, like eco-friendly firms or ones that treat workers well.
Real-World Use:
Investors, researchers, or even students can use these groups to compare companies, plan strategies, or study industries (e.g., why are chemical companies riskier?).
It’s like organizing a library so you can find the right book quickly.
For your friend’s professor, she can say: “This project groups companies to help people make smarter choices, like investing safely or studying what makes businesses stable or risky. It’s useful for understanding how different companies behave and why.”

How Does the Code Work?
The code is like a recipe for sorting the companies. It takes raw information about them (like stock prices and sizes) and turns it into groups labeled Safe, Moderate, and Risky. Let’s break it down into simple steps, like baking a cake, so your friend can explain what each part does.

Step 1: Getting the Information (Loading Data)
What Happens: We start with a file called merged_data.csv, like a big spreadsheet about 485 companies.
Details: For each company (e.g., Apple, Aflac), it lists:
Stock prices (open, high, low, close) every day.
How many shares are traded (volume).
How big the company is (market cap).
How risky it is compared to the market (beta).
Scores for environment (e.g., reducing pollution), social (e.g., worker fairness), and governance (e.g., honest management)—called ESG scores.
What business they’re in (e.g., Tech, Banking, Energy).
Dates for the data (like 14-04-2025).
Why: This is our raw material, like gathering flour and sugar before baking.
Step 2: Cleaning Up (Preprocessing)
What Happens: We make sure the data is ready to use:
Fix the date format (e.g., “14-04-2025”) so we can sort by time.
If any company is missing its business type (e.g., Tech), we skip it.
If ESG scores, market cap, or beta are missing, we fill them with the average value for that trait.
Why: It’s like washing vegetables before cooking—ensures everything is neat and usable.
Example: If Aflac has no governance score, we use the average score so it’s not left out.
Step 3: Making Useful Traits (Feature Engineering)
What Happens: We don’t use raw stock prices directly. Instead, we create 11 key traits for each company to describe it better:
Median Volatility: How much the stock price jumps daily (small jumps = steady, big jumps = risky).
Formula: (High - Low) / Open price, take the middle value over time.
Historical Volatility: How risky the stock is over months, based on daily changes.
Uses percentage changes in closing price, scaled to a year.
Momentum: If the stock is trending up or down (like a car speeding up).
Compares short-term (10-day) vs. long-term (30-day) average prices.
Volume Normalized: How much trading happens compared to company size.
Volume divided by market cap. 5–7. ESG Scores: Environment, social, and governance scores (higher = better).
Market Cap: Company size, made smaller with a math trick (log-transform) to compare easily.
Beta: How much the stock moves with the market (higher = riskier).
Highest Controversy: Biggest scandal score (higher = more issues).
Sector: Turned into a number based on average governance scores for that industry (e.g., Banks score high).
How: For each company, we:
Calculate daily volatility and trends over time (like checking Apple’s stock for a year).
Summarize into one row per company (e.g., Apple’s average risk, size, etc.).
Why: These traits are like a report card—they summarize what makes each company unique, like saying “Apple is big and steady” or “Albemarle is risky.”
Example: Apple might have low volatility (steady stock), big market cap (huge company), and good environment scores (cares about recycling).
Step 4: Making Traits Fair (Scaling)
What Happens: The traits have different sizes (e.g., market cap is huge, volatility is tiny). We adjust them to be on the same scale, like turning everything into a 0–1 score.
Why: It’s like making sure all players in a game have equal weight, so we don’t favor big numbers (market cap) over small ones (volatility).
Example: Apple’s market cap (~28.91) and volatility (~0.018) are scaled to compare fairly with Aflac’s smaller values.
Step 5: Sorting into Groups (Clustering)
What Happens: We use three methods to group companies based on their 11 traits:
K-Means:
Picks 3 groups and puts companies into the one they’re most like, like sorting toys by shape.
Keeps tweaking until groups are tight (similar companies together).
Hierarchical:
Starts with each company alone, then pairs similar ones, building a tree, like stacking blocks.
We cut the tree to get 3 groups.
DBSCAN:
Finds “crowds” of similar companies, like clumps of stars.
Companies too far from any crowd are called “noise” (outliers).
We test different settings to find the best crowds.
Why: Each method is a different way to organize, like sorting clothes by color (K-Means), size (Hierarchical), or style (DBSCAN). We try all three to see which makes the most sense.
Labels: We name the groups Safe, Moderate, Risky based on their traits:
Hierarchical: Cluster 0=Safe, Cluster 1=Moderate, Cluster 2=Risky.
K-Means: Cluster 1=Safe, Cluster 0=Moderate, Cluster 2=Risky.
DBSCAN: Cluster 0=Safe, Cluster 1=Moderate, Noise=Risky.
Step 6: Checking the Groups (Silhouette Score)
What Happens: We give each method a score (called silhouette score) to see how good the groups are:
High score (close to 1) = groups are clear and separate.
Low score (near 0) = groups are messy.
Our scores: Hierarchical (~0.225), K-Means (~0.217), DBSCAN (~0.197).
Why: It’s like grading how well we sorted the toys. Scores around 0.2 are okay for real-world data with many traits—not perfect, but good enough.
Example: Hierarchical’s score (0.225) means it did the best job separating Safe, Moderate, and Risky.
Step 7: Drawing Pictures (Visualization)
What Happens: We make 2D maps (called PCA plots) to show the groups, like plotting stars on paper:
Each dot is a company, colored by group (Safe=blue, Moderate=green, Risky=red).
DBSCAN’s Risky (noise) dots look different (like crosses).
Why: It helps us see if Safe companies are bunched together or if Risky ones are scattered, like checking if our sorting looks right.
Example: Safe dots (Apple, Abbott Labs) should form a big blob, Moderate (Aflac) a tight group, Risky (Albemarle) more spread out.
Step 8: Understanding the Groups (Interpretation)
What Happens: For each method, we describe the groups:
Average Traits: What the “typical” company in Safe, Moderate, or Risky looks like (e.g., Safe has low risk).
Industries: Which businesses are in each group (e.g., Moderate has banks).
Example Companies: Names like Apple (Safe) or Albemarle (Risky).
Why: This tells us what makes each group special, like saying “Safe companies are big and steady.”
Example: Hierarchical Safe has Apple, low risk, and many industries; Moderate has Aflac, great management, only banks.
Step 9: Saving the Results
What Happens: We save three files:
clustered_companies_hierarchical.csv, clustered_companies_kmeans.csv, clustered_companies_dbscan.csv.
Each lists every company, its traits, industry, and group (Safe, Moderate, Risky).
Why: It’s like keeping a sorted list so we can look up any company later, like checking if Amazon is Safe.
Example: In the Hierarchical file, Apple’s row says “Safe,” Aflac’s says “Moderate,” Albemarle’s says “Risky.”
Why Safe, Moderate, Risky? (The Clustering Logic)
Now, let’s explain why we labeled the groups Safe, Moderate, and Risky, focusing on the Hierarchical method (best results) but noting how K-Means and DBSCAN agree. This is the heart of the project, so I’ll make it clear for your friend to tell her professor why these labels make sense, using the traits and companies as proof.

Safe (Hierarchical Cluster 0, K-Means Cluster 1, DBSCAN Cluster 0)
Traits (Hierarchical averages):
Risk: Low median_volatility (0.0189, steady stocks), low beta (1.03, moves with market), low hist_volatility (0.273, consistent).
Size: Big marketCap (24.55, huge firms).
ESG: Good environmentScore (6.57), high socialScore (9.05), okay governanceScore (4.95), low highestControversy (1.80, few scandals).
Sectors: Mixed (GICS_Sector_encoded=5.0, many industries).
Industries: Tech (62 companies), Healthcare (57), Industrials (74), Consumer Staples (33), Utilities (30)—diverse and stable.
Companies: Apple (AAPL, Tech), Abbott Labs (ABT, Healthcare), AbbVie (ABBV, Healthcare), Agilent (A, Healthcare), Airbnb (ABNB, Consumer).
Size: ~300 companies, the biggest group (~60% of 485).
Why Safe? (Logic):

Steady Stocks:
Low volatility (0.0189 daily, 0.273 yearly) means stock prices don’t jump much, like a calm ride.
Beta (1.03) is average, so they don’t overreact to market dips.
Reason: Investors feel safe because their money won’t vanish suddenly, like saving in a strong bank.
Big Companies:
Market cap (24.55) shows they’re giants, like Apple (worth trillions).
Reason: Big firms are less likely to fail—they have lots of money and customers, like a sturdy house.
Many Industries:
Covers Tech (Apple), Healthcare (ABT), Staples (food, essentials), Utilities (power)—not tied to one risky business.
Reason: If Tech struggles, Healthcare or Staples can stay strong, spreading out risk, like having many friends to rely on.
Responsible but Balanced:
Good environment (6.57) and social (9.05) scores show they care about the planet and workers, but okay governance (4.95) means they’re not obsessed with rules.
Low controversies (1.80) mean few scandals.
Reason: They’re ethical enough to trust but not extreme, appealing to many people.
Example:
Apple: Huge, makes phones and computers, stock stays steady, trusted brand.
Abbott Labs: Makes medical devices, always needed, low risk.
Reason: These are companies you’d bet on to keep growing without big surprises.
Conclusion: Safe companies are big, steady, and spread across industries, like the reliable kids in class who always show up and do well.
Other Methods:

K-Means Cluster 1 (Safe): Same traits—low volatility (0.0171), big market cap (24.53), mixed sectors (Industrials 62, Healthcare 42). Companies: ABT, Accenture (ACN).
DBSCAN Cluster 0 (Safe): Matches with low volatility (0.0179), big size (24.48), diverse sectors. Companies: ABT, ACN.
Logic Check: All methods agree Safe is low-risk, big, and diverse, confirming the label.
Moderate (Hierarchical Cluster 1, K-Means Cluster 0, DBSCAN Cluster 1)
Traits (Hierarchical):
Risk: Very low median_volatility (0.0172, steadiest), low hist_volatility (0.243), low beta (1.06).
Size: Big marketCap (24.59, like Safe).
ESG: Low environmentScore (1.66, not green), high socialScore (9.74), very high governanceScore (9.00, great management), low highestControversy (1.66, clean).
Sectors: High GICS_Sector_encoded (8.91, governance-heavy).
Industries: Only Financials (67 companies, banks/insurance).
Companies: Aflac (AFL, Insurance), AIG (American International Group, Insurance), Arch Capital (ACGL, Insurance), Assurant (AIZ), Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG).
Size: ~150 companies (~30% of 485).
Why Moderate? (Logic):

Super Steady Stocks:
Lowest volatility (0.0172 daily, 0.243 yearly) means stocks barely move, even steadier than Safe.
Beta (1.06) is low, so they follow the market calmly.
Reason: Investors love this predictability—it’s like a train that’s always on time.
Big Companies:
Market cap (24.59) is big, like Safe, showing they’re major firms.
Reason: Large size means they’re stable, like a big store that won’t close suddenly.
Only Banks/Insurance:
All Financials, unlike Safe’s mix of industries.
Reason: Banks are tightly controlled by government rules, making them reliable. But focusing on one industry is less “safe” than Safe’s diversity—if banks struggle (e.g., loan issues), they’re all affected. This makes them “moderate”—steady but specialized.
Amazing Management:
Governance score (9.00) is the highest, meaning honest, clear leadership.
Social score (9.74) is great, but environment score (1.66) is low (they don’t focus on green projects).
Lowest controversies (1.66) show they avoid trouble.
Reason: High governance makes them trustworthy, like a school with strict but fair teachers. Low environment scores balance them—not perfect in every area, fitting “moderate.”
Example:
Aflac: Insurance company, steady stock, strong rules, helps workers with benefits.
AIG: Big insurer, well-managed after past fixes, trusted now.
Reason: These firms are dependable but stick to banking, so they’re not as flexible as Safe companies.
Conclusion: Moderate companies are ultra-steady and well-run but only in one industry (Financials), like the kids who follow every rule and stick together.
Other Methods:

K-Means Cluster 0 (Moderate): High governance (8.75), low volatility (0.0172), Financials-heavy (69). Companies: AFL, AIG, but also Apple (odd, should be Safe).
DBSCAN Cluster 1 (Moderate): High governance (9.10), lowest volatility (0.0164), Financials-only (55). Companies: AFL, AIG.
Logic Check: K-Means and DBSCAN confirm Moderate as governance-focused Financials, though K-Means’ Apple quirk slightly muddies it.
Risky (Hierarchical Cluster 2, K-Means Cluster 2, DBSCAN Noise)
Traits (Hierarchical):
Risk: High median_volatility (0.0278, jumpy stocks), high hist_volatility (0.417), high beta (1.56, very risky).
Size: Smaller marketCap (23.15, not as big).
ESG: High environmentScore (7.33, eco-friendly), decent socialScore (8.23), okay governanceScore (5.52), higher highestControversy (1.93, some issues).
Sectors: Mixed but volatile (GICS_Sector_encoded=4.99).
Industries: Consumer Discretionary (7), Materials (5), Tech (4), Energy (1)—small counts, but Materials and Energy are unstable.
Companies: Albemarle (ALB, Materials/Chemicals), AES (AES Corp, Energy), Amcor (AMCR, Materials), APA (APA Corp, Energy), BorgWarner (BWA, Auto Parts).
Size: ~35 companies (~7% of 485).
Why Risky? (Logic):

Jumpy Stocks:
High volatility (0.0278 daily, 0.417 yearly) means stocks swing a lot, like a wild ride.
Beta (1.56) is high, so they overreact to market changes (e.g., a market dip hurts them more).
Reason: Investors worry because their money could drop fast, like betting on a stormy day.
Smaller Companies:
Market cap (23.15) is smaller than Safe (24.55) or Moderate (24.59).
Reason: Smaller firms like Albemarle are less secure than Apple—they might struggle if sales drop, like a small shop in tough times.
Unstable Industries:
Materials (chemicals like ALB) and Energy (oil like APA) depend on things like lithium or oil prices, which change fast.
Consumer Discretionary (BWA, car parts) relies on people spending extra money, which stops in bad economies.
Reason: These businesses are like boats in choppy water—if prices crash, they’re hit hard, unlike Safe’s diverse mix.
Mixed Ethics:
High environment score (7.33) is good, but governance (5.52) is average, and controversies (1.93) are higher.
Reason: Weaker management and more issues (e.g., environmental fines) make them less trusted than Safe or Moderate.
Example:
Albemarle: Makes lithium for batteries, stock jumps with electric car trends, risky if demand falls.
AES: Energy company, affected by power price swings, not steady.
Reason: These firms are exciting (could grow big) but unpredictable, like gambling.
Conclusion: Risky companies are smaller, jumpy, and tied to unstable businesses, like the adventurous kids who might win big or cause trouble.
Other Methods:

K-Means Cluster 2 (Risky): High volatility (0.0269), high beta (1.47), smaller market cap (23.93), volatile sectors. Companies: ALB, AES, Airbnb.
DBSCAN Noise (Risky): Includes ALB, AES (volatile), but also Apple, ADM (106 noise points). Apple’s noise is odd (huge size makes it unique).
Logic Check: K-Means and DBSCAN’s Risky group/noise capture volatile firms like Hierarchical, confirming the label, though DBSCAN overdoes noise.
How the Methods Agree
All three methods tell a similar story:

Safe: Biggest group (~250–300 companies), low risk (volatility ~0.017–0.019), big size (~24.5), many industries (Tech, Healthcare). Companies like Abbott Labs (ABT) anchor it.
Moderate: Medium group (~80–150), very low risk (~0.016–0.017), high governance (~8.7–9.1), only Financials (AFL, AIG).
Risky: Smallest (~35–100 or noise), high risk (~0.027–0.028), smaller size (~23.1–23.9), volatile industries (Materials, Energy like ALB, AES).
Why Hierarchical Is Best:

Highest score (0.225 vs. 0.217 for K-Means, 0.197 for DBSCAN).
Puts Apple in Safe (correct, it’s steady), unlike K-Means (Moderate) or DBSCAN (Risky noise).
Cleanly splits Safe (diverse), Moderate (Financials), Risky (volatile).
Apple Note:

Hierarchical: Safe (makes sense, low volatility ~0.018).
K-Means: Moderate (odd, with banks).
DBSCAN: Risky noise (due to huge size).
Fix: Trust Hierarchical—it matches Apple’s stable nature.
Presenting to the Professor
Your friend can explain the project like this:

What We Did:

“I took data on 485 companies, like their stock prices, sizes, and how ethical they are. I used a computer program to sort them into three groups—Safe, Moderate, and Risky—based on how similar they are. I tried three sorting methods (Hierarchical, K-Means, DBSCAN) to find the best one.”
How It Works:

“The program looks at 11 things, like how much stocks jump, company size, and management quality. It calculates these for each company, makes them comparable, and groups them. Safe companies are big and steady, Moderate are well-run banks, and Risky are jumpy and smaller. I saved the results in files to check any company’s group.”
Why Safe, Moderate, Risky:

“Safe companies, like Apple, have steady stocks (low jumps ~0.019), are huge (~24.5 size), and cover many businesses (Tech, Healthcare). They’re safe because they won’t lose value fast.”
“Moderate companies, like Aflac, are super steady (~0.017 jumps), big, and only banks with great management (~9.0 score). They’re moderate because they’re reliable but stick to one industry.”
“Risky companies, like Albemarle, have jumpy stocks (~0.028), smaller size (~23.1), and unstable businesses (chemicals, oil). They’re risky because their value can drop quickly.”
Why We Did It:

“This helps people choose investments—Safe for steady growth, Moderate for reliability, Risky for big risks and rewards. It also shows why companies behave differently, like why banks are well-managed or why chemical firms are risky. It’s useful for investors or researchers.”
Results:

“The Hierarchical method worked best (score 0.225). It put ~300 companies in Safe (e.g., Apple), ~150 in Moderate (e.g., Aflac), and ~35 in Risky (e.g., Albemarle). The other methods agreed but had small quirks, like K-Means mixing Apple with banks.”
Visuals:

“I made maps showing the groups—Safe companies are bunched together, Moderate are tight, and Risky are scattered. This proves the groups are different.”
She can show:

Files: Open clustered_companies_hierarchical.csv to show columns like Symbol (AAPL), Cluster_Hierarchical (Safe).
Plots: The PCA plots (Safe=blue, Moderate=green, Risky=red) from the code.
Code: Share the modified code to prove she did the work.
If Questions Come Up
Professor Asks About Apple:
“Apple is Safe in Hierarchical because it’s big and steady. K-Means put it in Moderate, and DBSCAN called it Risky noise, likely because its huge size confused them. Hierarchical’s label makes the most sense.”
Why These Traits?:
“I used volatility, size, ESG, and sectors because they capture risk, stability, and ethics—key for investors and researchers.”
Why Three Groups?:
“Three groups (Safe, Moderate, Risky) are simple and match real-world needs—safe bets, reliable picks, and risky ventures.”
DBSCAN Noise:
“DBSCAN’s Risky group (noise) has 106 companies, including volatile ones like Albemarle but also Apple by mistake. It’s still useful for spotting outliers.”
If she wants to check a company (e.g., Nvidia, NVDA), she can:

python

Copy
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('clustered_companies_hierarchical.csv')
print(data[data['Symbol'] == 'NVDA'][['Symbol', 'Cluster_Hierarchical']])  # Likely Risky
Final Answer
Project Summary:

The project sorts ~485 companies into Safe, Moderate, and Risky groups using 11 traits (risk, size, ESG, sectors). It helps with investing, studying businesses, or understanding ethics by showing which companies are stable (Safe), well-run but focused (Moderate), or jumpy (Risky).
Code Explanation:

The code:
Loads company data (merged_data.csv).
Cleans it (fixes missing values).
Creates 11 traits (e.g., volatility, market cap).
Scales traits to compare fairly.
Groups companies using K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, labeling them Safe, Moderate, Risky.
Checks group quality (scores ~0.2).
Draws maps to show groups.
Describes each group (traits, industries, companies).
Saves results in CSVs (clustered_companies_hierarchical.csv, etc.).
Clustering Logic (Hierarchical):

Safe (Cluster 0, ~300 companies):
Why: Low risk (volatility ~0.0189, beta ~1.03), big size (market cap ~24.55), many industries (Tech, Healthcare). Companies like Apple (AAPL) are steady giants, unlikely to crash.
Logic: Steady stocks + big size + diversity = safe investment, like a strong house.
Moderate (Cluster 1, ~150):
Why: Lowest risk (volatility ~0.0172), big size (~24.59), only Financials with high governance (~9.0). Companies like Aflac (AFL) are super reliable but less diverse.
Logic: Ultra-steady + great management + one industry = reliable but specialized, like a strict but fair team.
Risky (Cluster 2, ~35):
Why: High risk (volatility ~0.0278, beta ~1.56), smaller size (~23.15), unstable industries (Materials, Energy). Companies like Albemarle (ALB) swing wildly.
Logic: Jumpy stocks + smaller size + volatile businesses = risky bet, like a wild adventure.
Why It’s Done:

To help choose investments (Safe for growth, Moderate for reliability, Risky for gambles), study company behavior, or check ethics. Hierarchical is best (score 0.225), correctly placing Apple in Safe, unlike K-Means (Moderate) or DBSCAN (Risky noise).
